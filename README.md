 ðŸŒ³ Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation

## ðŸ“Œ Description
This is a **Binary Search Tree** (BST) implementation I created during the last lectures of the **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** course at **ITI**.

The project includes:
- Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder traversals
- `Contains()` method to search for a value
- `Remove()` and `Clear()` operations
- Custom `ToString()` and `GetEnumerator(TraversalMethod)` implementations
